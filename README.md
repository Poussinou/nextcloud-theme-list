# Nextcloud Theme List

First of all, visit the customization section in the official store [here](https://apps.nextcloud.com/categories/customization). You'll find for example a pride theme, or a tool to randomly change the background with unsplash.

## List of available themes

Be careful, some of them might be very old, probably too old for your instance, and I haven't tested them all.
